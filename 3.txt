3. Exercise #3 : Defect reporting
In you opinion, when reporting a bug, what would you include in the given report? (name, description, date, etc).
Feel free to think of any relevant fields that may help with identifying the bug and making it understandable for the entire team.
Design a template for a bug report.
Template:
	-name
	-location where was found
	-what it does
	-the severity
	-when was found
	-by whom was found
	-others
